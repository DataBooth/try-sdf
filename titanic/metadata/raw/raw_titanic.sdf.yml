    Source data - "1999 Original" (titanic3) - see https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/titanic.
    This data set has been replicated many times across many data repositories (below is the description of the dataset.)
    The titanic and titanic2 data frames describe the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. 
    The titanic data frame does not contain information from the crew, but it does contain actual ages of 
    half of the passengers. The principal source for data about Titanic passengers is the Encyclopedia Titanica. 
    The datasets used here were begun by a variety of researchers. One of the original sources is 
    Eaton & Haas (1994) Titanic: Triumph and Tragedy, Patrick Stephens Ltd, which includes a passenger list 
    created by many researchers and edited by Michael A. Findlay.
    Thomas Cason of UVa has greatly updated and improved the titanic data frame using the Encyclopedia Titanica and
    created a new dataset called titanic3.  These datasets reflects the state of data available as of 2 August 1999. 
    Some duplicate passengers have been dropped, many errors corrected, many missing ages filled in, and new variables created.
