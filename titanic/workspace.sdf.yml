    Titanic example with simple transformations.

    Try compiling first with `sdf compile`. This validates all SQL and dependencies are correct.
    Then, run everything locally with `sdf run`. This will run the entire DAG locally.
    Lastly, track lineage with `sdf lineage`. Specify the fully qualified name after the command to see lineage for a specific table of column.
